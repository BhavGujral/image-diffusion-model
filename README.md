## 🛠️ Project Description

Diffusion models are generative models that iteratively denoise a random signal to generate meaningful output such as images. This notebook demonstrates:

- Noise addition and reversal process
- Implementation of the denoising step
- Training a basic model to reverse noise (denoise)
- Visualizing the diffusion and generation process
